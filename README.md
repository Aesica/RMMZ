## Aesica's RMMZ Plugins - Terms of Use
These terms apply to every RMMZ plugin in this repo:
- Free to use in both free and commercial projects as long as I am given credit.
- Forked versions of these plugins are fine as long as I am given credit and the forked version must remain free.
- You may edit the code as needed to fit your game
- You may NOT remove my name from the @author section, you may NOT remove the link to this readme from the @help section, and you may NOT attempt to otherwise pass my work off as your own (come on, we all know that's a dick move, so don't be one~)
- A copy of your game (once completed) would be nice so I can see how my scripts are being used, but it's not required.
- **Regarding AES_LootBox specifically (Once it's added..stand by!):**  You are NOT authorized to use this plugin to create microtransaction-based loot box systems in any game using this plugin.  This includes, but is not limited to, prize packs or keys (items required to open prize packs) that are purchased with real-world money or with a currency that is awarded as a direct (or indirect) result of spending real-world money via microtransactions.  In short, this plugin is fine for use in commercial games as long as they're not trying to profit off loot box systems.  This limitation supercedes any of the other terms and conditions listed here.

## How to Credit Me
- List my name (Aesica) in your game's credits under your scripts/code section, or under "Scripting" if you don't yet have a scripting section.  Easy peasy, right? :D

## Compatibility with ~~Yanfly~~ Visustella plugins
No guarantees yet, but give it time!
